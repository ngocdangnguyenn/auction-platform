# AuctionTech â€“ Centime Auction Platform

## Overview
AuctionTech is a web application for online auctions, where users bid for high-tech products by proposing prices down to the cent. The winner is the user who offers the lowest unique bid. Originally developed as a graded university project, this repo now serves as a showcase of practical software engineering and data skills for internships and graduate studies.

## Key Features
- Modular backend (Flask, SQLAlchemy, app factory, blueprints)
- Secure authentication & role-based access (client/admin)
- Token-based bidding system
- Real-time auction logic (lowest unique bid, automatic refunds)
- Admin dashboard (manage products, auctions, users, token packs)
- Client dashboard (bidding, account management, notifications)
- Responsive frontend (Bootstrap, custom CSS, interactive JS)
- Dockerized for reproducibility & deployment
- Automated testing (pytest), code quality (flake8, black, isort, pre-commit)
- Environment-based configuration for security
